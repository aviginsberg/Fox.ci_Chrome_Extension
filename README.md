Fox.ci - A furry URL shortener :3
=================================

This is a chrome extension for [fox.ci](http://fox.ci), based on the original extension: [b9nnQ5E](http://fox.ci/b9nnQ5E)

I've taken it upon myself to rewrite this extension, mostly because I don't like how the original code was laid out :3

I don't claim ownership over fox.ci or the original extension, those are: [aviginsberg](https://github.com/aviginsberg)'s

How to use:
-----------

This is nice and simple. 
- Click the extension icon and the current tab URI will be shortened and copied to your clipboard.
- The second option will be to right-click a link and you will see a context-menu shorten option.
